  I'm an ambitious and detail-oriented Computer Science student with a strong passion for collaboratively building innovative and impactful software products. My expertise lies in C++, Python, DevOps, AWS, and frontend development, and I’ve applied these skills to both academic and real-world projects.

  I’ve made contributions to open-source projects and have a solid foundation in performance testing, system optimization, and algorithm development. Additionally, I’ve honed my problem-solving abilities by solving numerous challenges on platforms like LeetCode.

  In my current role as part of the QA team, I ensure the delivery of high-quality software by thoroughly testing real-world applications. I’m actively seeking opportunities in a reputed organization to continue growing my skills and collaborate on cutting-edge solutions in the field of software development.

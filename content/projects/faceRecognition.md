This project implements an automated attendance system using facial recognition technology to accurately track student participation. By scanning images captured by a camera, the system identifies individuals and logs their attendance efficiently. Leveraging advanced libraries for image processing and facial recognition, this solution enhances the accuracy and reliability of attendance management in educational settings.

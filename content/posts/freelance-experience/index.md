title: Freelance & Open Source Contributions
description: "I worked as a freelance engineer, delivering projects to local and Internation Clients where I containerized apps, automated workflows, provide them their desired product and collaborated on real-world Software Applications. My work led to repeated Clients, projects and referrals.

Alongside freelancing, I contributed to couple of Open-Source projects like NumFOCUS, TYPO3 Best Practices, Aeon Toolkit, FOSSology and Rocker.Chat etc... from working on Critical Bugs to raised new bugs, updating testing frameworks,  working on documentation, creating Jupyter notebooks that integrate time-series models with scikit-learn and couple of other Areas.

This mix of freelance and open-source work strengthened my skills in cloud-native development, collaboration, testing and problem-solving, while building credibility in both client and community sides."

title: How does TypeScript support optional parameters in function as every parameter is optional for a function in JavaScript?
description: "Optional parameters are those parameters whose value may or may not be provided as an argument during the function call. Their value is set to undefined when they are not provided as an argument.
It is different from a default parameter for which we need to provide a default value at the time of defining the function."

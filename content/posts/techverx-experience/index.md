description: "During my time as a remote Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Techverx, I played an integral role in ensuring the delivery of high-quality software products. I was responsible for designing detailed test plans, scenarios, and procedures that aligned with the project's functional requirements. My work involved executing comprehensive smoke, regression, and integration tests to validate the software's functionality and stability.

A key aspect of my role was documenting and reporting software defects using industry-standard bug-tracking tools such as Jira and ClickUp. I collaborated closely with software developers, participating in product design reviews to provide input on functional requirements and proactively identify potential issues. I also monitored the progress of bug resolution efforts, ensuring timely and effective fixes.

Additionally, I conducted both positive and negative testing, ensuring thorough coverage of potential use cases. My contributions were instrumental in enhancing the software's performance and usability. Throughout this process, I utilized a variety of tools, including Postman for API testing, PowerShell for automation, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure to simulate diverse environments.

This experience not only deepened my expertise in software testing methodologies but also honed my problem-solving skills and my ability to thrive in a collaborative, fast-paced environment."
